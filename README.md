# mare-portfolio

Static site - graphic designer portfolio. Image processing via eleventy.

## 11ty
This section documents the plugins used to improve dev experience.

### Navigation
- [Responsive & accessible navigation](https://katiekodes.com/responsive-navigation-1/)
- [11ty nav docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/nav/)

## CSS
CSS reset styles are inlined using [clean-css](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/).

### Layout
[Single-line](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/) layouts are cool. I'm using the Pancake stack.

## Image optimization
We will need to make sure the website loads as fast as possible, so the images will need to be optimized and loaded only when really needed. Also the thumbnails will need to be generated per each image.
